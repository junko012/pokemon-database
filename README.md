# Exxeguttor Pokemon Database

A portable SQLite Pokémon database designed for the Exxeguttor ecosystem and third-party applications.

## Overview

Exxeguttor Pokemon Database is a consolidated Pokémon knowledge base generated from multiple public data sources and normalized into a single SQLite database.

The project was created to provide a fast, offline, language-independent data layer for:

* Desktop applications
* Web APIs
* AI systems
* Research projects
* Companion applications
* PKHeX integrations
* Data analysis tools

The database is distributed as a single SQLite file:

```text
pokemon.db
```

and can be consumed from any platform that supports SQLite.

## External Resources

The following resource is intentionally distributed outside the SQLite database:

```text
movesets_all_combined.json
```

Reason:

* Large file size
* Independent update cycle
* Competitive data changes frequently
* Optional consumption by client applications

Applications may load this resource separately when advanced moveset recommendations are required.

---

## Design Goals

* Portable
* Offline-first
* SQLite-native
* Language independent
* Fast local queries
* Easy integration
* Stable identifiers
* Minimal duplication

---

## Generation

This database is generated using:

```text
Exxeguttor.DataBuilder
```

which transforms and normalizes Pokémon data into a relational SQLite structure.

---

## Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in:
